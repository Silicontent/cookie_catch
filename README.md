# Cookie Catch!

### Overview
This is my first true Pygame project. It's incredibly simple: all you
have to do is catch the falling cookies in the cookie jar. Move using the arrow keys. You can
move off of the screen to teleport to the other side.

### Credits
I'd like to thank RealPython for the Pygame primer article. Without it,
I would've never learned Pygame syntax. Also, thanks to the users on StackOverflow
for making me realize that, to see things on the screen, you need to blit() them on
the screen (yes, I had to ask about that). Finally, the font used for the score,
called Pixel Emulator, was created by Pixel Sagas at https://www.fontspace.com/pixel-emulator-font-f21507.
